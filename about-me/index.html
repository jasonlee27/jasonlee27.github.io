    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <font size="4px"> 
      I am currently a graduate research assistant at the University of Texas at Dallas, working with <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/">Dr.Gopal Gupta</a> and <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~swei/">Dr.Shiyi Wei</a>. My research interests include <b>Explainable AI (XAI)</b>, <b>Machine Learning (ML)</b>, <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>, and <b>Software Engineering (SWE)</b>. Additionally, I have explored debugging ML models in NLP, Computer Vision (CV), and SWE by analyzing and explaining their behavior. My work also involves developing ML/NLP models for various applications, such as an evolving programming assistant tool, a video compression scheme using CV models, and an action recognition system.
