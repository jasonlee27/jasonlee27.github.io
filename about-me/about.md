I am currently a graduate research assistant at the University of Texas at Dallas, working with Dr.[Gopal Gupta](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/)
and Dr.[Shiyi Wei](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~swei/). My research interests include Explainable AI (XAI), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Software Engineering (SWE). Additionally, I have explored debugging ML models in NLP, Computer Vision (CV), and SWE by analyzing and explaining their behavior. My work also involves developing ML/NLP models for various applications, such as an evolving programming assistant tool, a video compression scheme using CV models, and an action recognition system.
